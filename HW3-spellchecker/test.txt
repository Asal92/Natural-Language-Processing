we went over the football field it was quite wet and soon made my toes cold.
the grass was quite long now it shon with the dew on it.
a field ploud next to it I think it was don yesterday.
on the other side was an hedge
it had a lot of thorns in it .
they hade cleand the river and made it very wide fore the ducks
there were some potato in the water .
there were some brussels men sitting in the parth way round a fire
we had to go on to a ploud field to get round them this made my shoes hevey .
this was quite muddy
some boys did not think much to it nor did I but we still went.
the dew on the brussels leaves made them look pirls.
Mr. Holbrook went over the brook first
some were boys going round but only one went

one foot toch the water
then we went across the new pice of grass into school
we went and cleand our shoes with paper
