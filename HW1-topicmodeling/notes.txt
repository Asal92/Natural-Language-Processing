My approach:

1- read lines of the text file
2- change all characters to lower case
3- made a list of words that alone don't have any meaning (started with prepositions)
4- removed those words from the lines
5- count every words to see how many times they've been used in the file
6- make a dictionary where keys are words, values are their repetition
7- select 5 values form the dictionary with max values
